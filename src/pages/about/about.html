            <p>A FEW WORDS ABOUT ME</p>
            <p>I’m Zihad Malik, a multidisciplinary designer who focuses on telling my clients’ stories visually,
                through enjoyable and meaningful experiences. I specialize in responsive websites and functional user
                interfaces.</p>
            <p> Over the past 9 years I have been working with different companies and rising startups around the world
                as a designer and art director, working solo and leading medium design teams. In my spare time I enjoy
                photography and motorcycle adventures.</p>
